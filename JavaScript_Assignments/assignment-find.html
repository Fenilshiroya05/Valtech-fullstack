      It's not only writers who can benefit from this free online tool. If
      you're a programmer who's working on a project where blocks of text are
      needed, this tool can be a great way to get that. It's a good way to test
      your programming and that the tool being created is working well. Above
      are a few examples of how the random paragraph generator can be
      beneficial. The best way to see if this random paragraph picker will be
      useful for your intended purposes is to give it a try. Generate a number
      of paragraphs to see if they are beneficial to your current project. If
      you do find this paragraph tool useful, please do us a favor and let us
      know how you're using it. It's greatly beneficial for us to know the
      different ways this tool is being used so we can improve it with updates.
      This is especially true since there are times when the generators we
      create get used in completely unanticipated ways from when we initially
      created them. If you have the time, please send us a quick note on what
      you'd like to see changed or added to make it better in the future.
